## Approach Explanation  

### 1. Brute Force 
- Check every possible triplet `(i, j, k)`
- If their sum = 0 â†’ add to result (avoid duplicates with set)  
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n^3)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n^2)` (for storing results)

### 2. Two-Pointer Approach
- Sort the array.  
- Loop through each element `nums[i]`:
  - Skip duplicates for `i`.
  - Use two pointers (`left`, `right`) to find pairs that make the sum 0 with `nums[i]`.
- Move pointers accordingly:
  - If sum < 0 â†’ `left++`
  - If sum > 0 â†’ `right--`
  - If sum = 0 â†’ store triplet and skip duplicates.
- Continue until all unique triplets are found.
 
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n^2)`  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` (excluding result)
